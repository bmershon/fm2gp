A proof can be found further on in the text on page 66.

**Hint:** Prove the contrapositive by first assuming n is not prime (and is therefore a product of two positive integers greater than 1).

**Hint-hint:** Consider how exponents may be rearranged to obtain an expression which lends itself to the use of the difference of powers formula.
