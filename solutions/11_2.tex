\textit{Solution.}

The symmetric group $S_n$ is the set of all permutations on $n$ elements. A permutation presents the opportunity to choose $n$ elements which will be assigned the \textit{first} position in the shorthand notation for permutations (e.g., $(2 \quad 4 \quad 1 \quad 3)$), $n - 1$ elements for the second position, $n - 2$ elements for the third, and so on until we reach $n - (n - 1) = 1$ choices for the \textit{last} element.

Since each choice is independent of the other, we may multiply these choices in what might be visualized as a tree-like structure with $n!$ leaves. There are $n!$ elements in the symmetric group $S_n$.
