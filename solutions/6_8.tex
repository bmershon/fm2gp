\textit{Solution.}

Let $b = g^n$ for some generating element $g$ in G. Let $a = g^m$.

We want to show that our arbitrary $a$ and $b$ chosen from a cyclic group will satisfy

$$a \circ \b = b \circ a$$

We can use the Commutativity of Powers (6.1) to show that a cyclic group is indeed \textit{abelian}.

\begin{align*}
    a \circ b &= g^n g^m = g^m g^n = b a = b \circ a
\end{align*}

This holds for any $a$ and $b$, as $a$ and $b$ were chosen arbitrarily.
